FlappyBoy
========= 

This is clone of Flappy Bird I made to learn about the Game Boy and how to build a really simple game for it.

The tools I used are:
- [RGBDS](https://bitbucket.org/JustinLloyd/rgbds-gameboy-development-system) to assemble my code
- [BGB](http://bgb.bircd.org/) to test and debug
- [EverDrive GB](http://krikzz.com/store/home/8-everdrive-gb.html) to run the game on device

Here you can play the game on an online emulator.
